"You can include images in user research studies by uploading static images from your local environment, taking snapshots of single or multiple pages from your prototype application, or uploading Norman or Axure interactive HTML prototype applications.",
"Files are added to the project Docs folder if you upload them directly from the Documents page, or if you add them to the project prototype application or user research studies.",
"You your pause or archive your research studies. Particpants cannot respond to paused or archived studies. You can restart paused or archived studies whenever you want.",
"You can add single or multiple questions for each image or page you include in a user research study. When a participant is responding to the study, each question is displayed simultaneously to the image you asked the question about.",
"The Prototype module is disabled in Build 1.0.",
"To create a user research study you must first create a Build project, and then create the study within that project. In the project, you create the user research study by adding images and ask questions about those images. Then you publish the study to generate a study-link, which you can send to third parties by email.",
"You can invite your colleagues to become team of a project you created or a project you are a team member .",
"The Data Model module is disabled in Build 1.0.",
"Publishing a research study generates a unique URL that you send to third parties, such as colleagues or end-users, to invite them to participate in your research study.",
"You can create a team for your project by inviting colleagues to collaborate as project team members. You can also be invited to become a team member of other Build users  projects.",
"You can upload image, document, and media files you require for a project to the project Docs folder. In addition, documents you upload to the project prototype application and user research studies are automatically added to the Docs folder.",
"When you use Build you are always working on a project. You can create multiple projects in Build. In each Build project you can create a unique HTML prototype application, invite other colleagues to become contributing team members, and create user research studies specific to the project.",
"The Build user research module enables you to quickly create and share user research studies to gather feedback from colleagues or end-users about images, project pages, or complete interactive Norman or Axure HTML prototype applications. Team members of a project can create user research studies about that project. In the project, you create the user research study by adding images and asking questions about those images. Then you publish the study to generate a study-link, which you can send to third parties by email.",
"To particpate in a Build user research study, participants enter a unique Build user research study-link URL in their browser and respond to questions about each image. The then enter responses to the them questions and images.",
"You create Build projects on the Home page of Build.",
"The name and description of your user research studies are displayed to participants if they display the study-link in their browser. The name and description should help the participants to understand what the study is about, and why they are being asked to participate.",
"",
"You can view participants  response to your research studies almost as soon as they enter them in their browser. A tile for each user research study created for the project is displayed on the Research and Feedback page.",
